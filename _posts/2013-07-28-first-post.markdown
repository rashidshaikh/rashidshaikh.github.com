summary: Finally I am here, started writing !!. I tried many times to post something on by blog but never succeeded. I am a Application Developer and my goal behind creating this blog is to have a repository of things those I have been experiencing while coding. In my day to day life, I usually come across many frameworks, methodologies, problems, techniques etc. I solve many problems but there is one thing missing i.e sharing my learning with others.

Finally I am here, started writing !!. I tried many times to post something on by blog but never succeeded. I am a Application Developer and my goal behind creating this blog is to have a repository of things those I have been experiencing while coding. In my day to day life, I usually come across many frameworks, methodologies, problems, techniques etc. I solve many problems but there is one thing missing i.e sharing my learning with others. 

In first 2-3 posts I'll be covering the frameworks which are being used to create and host this site. I am using a open source blog aware framework [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to create this site and [github.com](http://github.com) to host it. (yes you read it correctly "github.com"). I am using [entrydns.com](entrydns.com) to manage my DNS and [disqus.com](disqus.com) as a commenting platform. I'll be writing about all these things in detail in my upcoming posts, Stay tuned!!
