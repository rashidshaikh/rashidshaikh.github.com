summary: Finally i am here, started writing !!. I tried many times to post something on by blog but never got success. I am a Application Developer and my goal behind creating this blog is to have a repository of things those i have been experiencing while coding. In my day to day life i usually come across many frameworks, methodologies, problems, techniques etc. I solve many problems but there is one thing missing i.e sharing my learning with other.

Finally i am here, started writing !!. I tried many times to post something on by blog but never got success. I am a Application Developer and my goal behind creating this blog is to have a repository of things those i have been experiencing while coding. In my day to day life i usually come across many frameworks, methodologies, problems, techniques etc. I solve many problems but there is one thing missing i.e sharing my learning with other. 

In first 2-3 posts i'll covering the frameworks which are being used to create and host this site. I am using a open source blog aware framework "Jekyll" to create this site and github.com to host it. (yes you read it correctly "github.com"). I am using entrydns.com to manage my DNS and disqus.com as a commenting platform. I'll be writing about all these things in detail in my upcoming posts, Stay tuned !!
